# codebasedcryptoBlockchain
implementing a blockchain with sha256 hashing and digital signatures using code based crypto

Basic blockchain system implemented using CPP

This project implements 3 code based digital signature algorithms - 
KKS - https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0024461
Stern Identification - https://www.di.ens.fr/~stern/data/St47.pdf  (adapted from identification scheme using fiat-shamir transform https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-47721-7_12)
and a New Code Based Digital signature scheme - https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/294.pdf

You need MAGMA computer algebra system to run the KKS scheme
